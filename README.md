## 💬 ACTIVA CHAT 💬

_Chat made as final project of the Node.js course by [Daniel Españadero](https://github.com/DanielEspanadero) at IT Academy in Barcelona._

## Starting 🚀

_These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes._
_The project has two servers, the client side to create the 'seo friendly' routes and the server side to configure the backend part (Sockets, Json Web Tokens, REST apis...). Remember to start both servers individually, each on a different port._
